Make a pomodoro timer

default

25:00 countdown

5:00 rest

make it a runnable app (use kivy)

step 1: need to make a countdown from 25 minutes
    STATUS: this is completed, except it counts down from 1500 seconds

step 2: convert 1500 seconds into 25:00 format
    STATUS: this is completed

step 3: make a countdown from 25:00 to 0:00
    STATUS: this is completed, not sure if code is optimal but it works

step 4: make a 5:00 break timer

step 5: make break timer start after the 25:00 timer

step 6: make a counter for 25:00 timers and every 4 make a break that is 15 minutes instead


TROUBLESHOOTING
-APP freezes after beginning countdown



***later on, ask user for input to adjust time needed

*** let user type something/press button to start the timer

*** make the GUI using KIVY or something else
