# Pomodoro_App
Pomodoro App using Kivy.
This is an app made using the Kivy framework in Python. The timer uses the popular time management system, the pomodoro technique, to cycle through "work" and "break" periods.

## How it works
For the "work" periods,  the timer will countdown from 25 minutes. After the 25 minute "work" cycle is completed, a 5 minute break is allowed. After completing 4 consecutive "work" cycles, a 15 minute "long break" timer will begin.

## Features
